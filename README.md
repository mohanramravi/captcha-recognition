# captcha-recognition

The objective of this machine learning project is to develop an accurate and reliable neural network model for recognizing CAPTCHA images. The model will be trained on a large dataset of CAPTCHA images and evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify new, unseen images. Machine learning and deep learning models will be trained on a dataset of 1040 CAPTCHA images by splitting the dataset into respective training and test sets.

RNN is the explored NN model for this project. 
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network architecture that is designed to process sequential data, such as time series data, speech signals, and natural language text. Unlike traditional neural networks, which process each input independently, an RNN is capable of processing sequential data by maintaining a "memory" of the previous inputs and using that information to make predictions about the current input.
The key feature of an RNN is the presence of recurrent connections between neurons, which allow information to flow backwards as well as forwards through the network. This enables the network to maintain a "memory" of previous inputs, and to use that information to make predictions about the current input.
There are several types of recurrent layers used in RNNs, including the Simple Recurrent Unit (SRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). These layers are designed to address the "vanishing gradient" problem that can occur when training deep neural networks with traditional gradient descent methods.
